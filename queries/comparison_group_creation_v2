-- This query builds a comparison group (v2) of Brazilian scientific articles that:
-- (1) Share research topics (OpenAlex concepts, level 3, score > 0.7) with UIC publications;
-- (2) Were published in the SAME YEAR as the UIC articles they match;
-- (3) Have an average score > 0.75 for those shared concepts, ensuring stronger thematic alignment;
-- (4) Were NOT part of the original UIC sample;
-- (5) Involve ONLY Brazilian institutions, and do NOT involve universityâ€“industry collaboration.
--
-- These constraints improve the comparability between the UIC sample and the control group
-- for analyses of scientific impact, citations, open access, etc.
