-- This query identifies scientific articles published between 2012 and 2022 
-- that are not part of the original sample of university-industry collaborations, 
-- but share high-level research topics (concepts with score > 0.7) with those publications.

-- The query proceeds in the following steps:
-- 1. Selects all distinct concepts (level 3) with score > 0.7 from the original sample 
--    stored in `sample_creation_v4`.
-- 2. Finds all other publications in OpenAlex that are associated with those selected concepts,
--    but are not included in the original sample.
-- 3. Filters these publications to include only articles with:
--    - Brazilian-only institutional affiliations (i.e., all authors from institutions in Brazil),
--    - No simultaneous collaboration between companies and educational institutions,
--    - Document type = 'article',
--    - Publication year between 2012 and 2022.
